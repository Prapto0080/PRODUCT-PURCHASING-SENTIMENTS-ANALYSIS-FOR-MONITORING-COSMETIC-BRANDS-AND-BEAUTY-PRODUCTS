The study centers on the comprehensive analysis of user responses, 
gathered through a meticulously designed survey instrument, to discern prevailing trends 
and preferences in moisturizers, serums, and oils. The dataset, comprising responses from 
511 participants, provides a rich source of information on brand perceptions, country-of
origin preferences, and consumer ratings. By employing Python programming and data 
visualization libraries, I conducted an in-depth exploration of consumer habits, shedding 
light on the popularity of specific brands and the countries associated with favored 
cosmetic products.
